    <h1>Service</h1>
    <p>Giving back to the community is an integral part of who I am, and I engage in many
        volunteer and mentoring roles to make a positive impact. As a Volunteer Coordinator for
        BAPS Charities since January 2016, I have led teams in organizing and executing
        community-focused projects, particularly in health and wellness. My role involves
        mentoring volunteers, managing resources, and orchestrating events like the Annual
        Health Fair, where we prescreen patients and conduct BMI-related measurements to
        enhance community health awareness. To learn more about <a href="https://www.baps.org/home.aspx">BAPS</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.bapscharities.org/">BAPS Charities</a> please click the respective links.
        
       </p>
    <p>
        At Texas A&M University, I am also an active member of the Philanthropy Committee for
        Aggie Classics, where I help coordinate fundraising events to support Rescue Pink, an
        organization dedicated to empowering women and children in need. From organizing
        bracelet-making events to leading our annual Walkathon, I am committed to raising funds
        and awareness for this important cause, with the goal of contributing over $10,000
        annually. To learn more about Aggie Classics please click <a href="https://aggieclassics.wixsite.com/aggieclassics">here.</a>
        I also participate in the annual Big Event in College Station, where thousands of
        Texas A&M students come together to say “Thank You” to the residents of Bryan and
        College Station by completing service projects such as yard work, window washing, and
        painting for residents of the community. To learn more about Big Event please click <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">here.</a>
