    <h1>Qualifications</h1>
    <p>My technical skills span a wide range of programming languages, development tools, and methodologies,
        reflecting a solid foundation in both software and data engineering. I am proficient in languages such as
        Java, Python, SQL, and C++, which have allowed me to tackle complex programming challenges and
        develop robust, efficient solutions. My experience with Azure Synapse, PySpark, and cloud computing
        platforms has further strengthened my ability to work with large-scale data, ensuring that I can handle
        everything from data ingestion to analysis and reporting. Additionally, I am skilled in web development
        technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces and
        applications.

       </p>
       <p> I have an interest in data science, health tech, and artificial intelligence (AI). My fascination with data
        science stems from its ability to uncover patterns and insights from vast amounts of information, which
        can be leveraged to solve complex problems across various industries. I am particularly drawn to the
        intersection of data science and health tech, where I see enormous potential for improving healthcare
        outcomes through data-driven decision-making. Projects like my Yoga Schedule Builder app reflect this
        interest, as they combine my passion for health tech with my technical skills in data processing and user
        interface design.
    
    </p>
        <p>
            AI is another area that deeply intrigues me due to its transformative impact on technology and society.
            The ability of AI to learn, adapt, and solve problems autonomously opens up endless possibilities for
            innovation. I am eager to explore how AI can be integrated with data science and health tech to develop
            intelligent systems that enhance human well-being and efficiency. Whether it's using AI to predict health
            trends or developing algorithms that drive financial literacy tools, I am passionate about harnessing the
            power of these technologies to create solutions that make a real difference.
